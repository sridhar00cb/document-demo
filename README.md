# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

### Build

To generate the static content for the site, use the following command:


```
$ npm run build
```
This will output the static content to the build directory, which can then be served by any static content hosting service. Please note that the search functionality will only be available after running the build process.

### Serve

To preview the site locally, you can serve the generated content using:

```
$ npm run serve
```

This will serve the static content in the build directory on a local server.
